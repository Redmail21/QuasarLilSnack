My first game, used lua, took me like 3 months, i know, sounds  like a lot of time for such a small and cute game but hey, i really had to grasp the basics of everything, from game movement, DeltaTime, trigonometry, right now I'm shape for greater stuff. Feel free to play it or use it as a base for anything else, just have fun!.
